AIP Script Generator.

Parse through AIPs and create the following files from originals. 

Inputted Race: *

ORIGINAL FILES: 

bzceasy_s0(Core).aip
bzcnorm_s0(Core).aip
bzchard_s0(Core).aip
bzcextr_s0(Core).aip

Create:

bzceasy_*0.aip
bzcnorm_*0.aip
bzchard_*0.aip
bzcextr_*0.aip


For all of these AIPs, replace: "sb

with: "*b

and: "sv

with "*v

And then to make Moon(default) world, replace: REPLACE"

with: "


Next handle the World Letter, these are on the end of every ODF built by 
the AIP. Have a seperate file list each world letter to create, with the 
first AIP set being none.  

Append the world letter to each AIP File name, per world, so you make.

Inputted World Letter: &

bzceasy_*0&.aip
bzcnorm_*0&.aip
bzchard_*0&.aip
bzcextr_*0&.aip

For These AIP files, since we already setup the RACE, we just need to add 
the world letter to the end. The CORE AIPs are already setup for this process.

Replace: REPLACE" 

with: &"


Next, generate the different Team variations. For each of the AIPs made, 
Generate one for each number, 0 - 4. A Total of 5. Loop through for each
#.

bzceasy_*#&.aip
bzcnorm_*#&.aip
bzchard_*#&.aip
bzcextr_*#&.aip

For the following coorsponding number, replace the following:

replace: "0

with: "#

Then, replace: ForceStagePoint = N 

with: ForceStagePoint = (N + 3*#) 

So that ForceStagePoint = 1 turns into ForceStagePoint = 4 in # 1, and 
ForceStagePoint = 3 turns into ForceStagePoint = 15 in aip # 4.


Next, create the THUG AIPs, these are quite simpler. Follow the same 
2 steps for Race and World letter. But there's only one, so no need 
to mess with #.s

Original File:

bzcthug_s(Core).aip

Inputted Race letter: *

bzcthug_*.aip

repalce: "sb
with: "*b

and: "sv
with: "*v

World Letter: &

Replace: REPLACE"

with: &"
